# convex-neural-network
Matlab toolbox to design and train convex and log-log-convex neural networks

This Matlab toolbox provides some tools that, interfacing
with the Matlab Neural Network Toolbox, allows to design and train
log-sum-exp and posynomial feedforward neural networks.

In order to install the toolbox it suffices to run the file
Convex_Neural_Network.mltbx
